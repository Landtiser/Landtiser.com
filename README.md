The redeveloped front-end architecture of http://landtiser.com.

As part of a process to refine a front-end architecture documentation, I rehauled my personal website. CSS follows a customized combination of BEM and SMACSS standards.

A Gulp workflow concatinates, minifies, and optimizes the code and images for the final result on the live site. Multiple testing methods confirmed a <1.0 second loading time, 238kb of files, and 21 http requests; a substantial improvement over the previous incarnation.
